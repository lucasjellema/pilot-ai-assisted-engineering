Code examples are often correct, but need to be sceptically analysed as they can sometimes contain small mistakes.\n\nThese AI tools are also great for rubber ducking and general exploration of ideas, like figuring out how to implement something.\n\nThe pitfall of all AI tools is that lesser known topics are underrepresented in their training data, leading them to make more errors and confidently make information up on the spot.
