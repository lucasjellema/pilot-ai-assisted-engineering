But I often run into issues where the generated code just doesn't work properly, and I need multiple/many iterations to actually get the code in a working state. \nAnd what I've seen happening quite often is that a next iteration solves 1 issue, but at the same time breaks functionality that was working in a previous iteration. This is generally due to the fact that the AI generates and interpretes the code, but does not actually run it.",

My experience with generative AI has been very mixed so far. In many cases the AI hallucinates by inventing libraries and functions that do not exist because it is trained to always give you a solution to the question you ask. I have much better experience letting AI analyze my code to make optimizations and create test coverage kind of making it my test driven development partner (make test, make simple code, use test to prove it works, AI optimized code, use test to prove it still works). Also using AI to explain hard to read code as in, what does a function do without having to dissect it myself.",
    "Objectives, Priorities and Expectations": "I participate because AI is here to stay and I want to use it to offload as many \"boring\" and \"basic\" stuff that I can as it is both cheaper to do so and it leaves me with more time to spent on the more complex/interesting parts of an application. As I said in the previous answer my experience with generative AI is pretty mixed at the moment so I want to accomplish is have a good set of tools that I can trust and have a good understanding of which tasks I can offload and which task are better to be handled by a human.",
